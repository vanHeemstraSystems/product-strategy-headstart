# 100 - Introduction

A product strategy is a high-level plan for a team/company to achieve a certain goal or goals with a product/service. These goals are derived from the product vision which plays a key role in the product strategy. Using the product vision I can clearly define the following my product strategy: 

- for whom we’re building the product/service

- which problem it solves

- how the product will look like

- what the business goals are

- etc. 

A product strategy should always be related to a product vision. There’s a quote from Dave Ramsey that says: 

*“A goal without a plan is just a dream."*

Let’s do the math!

*Product Vision vs. Product Strategy*

Everything starts with a dream. To make it come true, it’s important to develop a plan.
