# 200 - The Timeframe of a Product Strategy

I’ve had multiple discussions on the time constraints of building a product strategy. These days you see more and more Product Managers and Leads categorizing everything that’s longer than 6-12 months as “product strategy.” In my opinion, the strategy shouldn’t be longer than 2 years, especially in these very uncertain times. 

If goals and milestones are shorter, they fall into the category of a roadmap. I think it’s not easy to nail it down in 6, 7, or more months. It depends on many factors such as the:

- industry (e.g. healthcare vs. online gaming)

- customer relationship (B2B vs. B2C)

- release cycles

- promised delivery date/ETAs

- and more

The problem with "roadmaps” that are longer than 12 months is that you likely won’t be able to hit them.
